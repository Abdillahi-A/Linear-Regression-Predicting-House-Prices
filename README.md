# Linear Regression for Predicting House Prices


## Goal:
In this project we will be working the [Boston House Price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices). We will create a linear model that will predict the median value of a home given a set of features.

This data set contains the following features:

* CRIM     per capita crime rate by town
* ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
* CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
* NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
* RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
* AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
* DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
* RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
* TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
* PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
* B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
* LSTAT    % lower status of the population

## Result:

This simple linear regression achieved the following evaluation metrics.
